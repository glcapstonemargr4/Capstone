Faster R-CNN for RSNA-Pneumonia-Detection-Challenge Dataset by Keras Introduction

The objective is to  build an algorithm to detect a visual signal for pneumonia in medical images. Specifically, your algorithm needs to automatically locate lung opacities on chest radiographs.

The original code of Keras version of Faster R-CNN I used was written by yhenon (resource link: GitHub .) He used the PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS COCO datasets

We have modified the problem statement for our personal learning purpose We consider only those images which has lables coordinate in stage_2_train_labels.csv



#Project Structure

1)dcm to jpg .ipynb is the file to tranfom .dcm to jpg images in train and test floder

2) preposessing.ipynb is the file to preprocessing the (stage_2_train_labels.csv ) we have drop the values which doesnot conatin any coordinate values 

train.ipynb is the file to train the model. The configuration and model saved path are inside this file. frcnn_test_vgg.ipynb is the file to test the model with test images and calculate the mAP (mean average precision) for the model.


Base Model Vgg16

Its a one stage faster rcnn tranning model

Evaluation The training loss on the region proposal network and the Faster R-CNN core network is shown below. The results are evaluated on the mean average precision at the different intersection over union (IoU) thresholds.
